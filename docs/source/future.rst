Future Features
===============

For our future feature, our idea is to provide an extensive guide of Newton's Method implementation that includes scalar and vector valued functions with single and multiple inputs. As a part of this guide, we will provide visuals and in depth explanation of the algorithm. Provided we have enough time, we could also generate a nice, cleaned up trace table as a visual for the demo functions we use.
Additionally, we could also provide an extensive guide of the Hamiltonian Monte Carlo.
